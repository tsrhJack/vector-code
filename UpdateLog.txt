Worried about during average pieces of code using the number of sides from a trial in the session. Maybe should keep track of what sides are included in a session for averaging by context, so that if the first trial only used the left data, but the next trial used both, we don't miss the other leg...

worried about side not being an inpout for variable pull function. currently requires side as an input but doesn't use it

Need to figure out how to handle file lists with both controls and non-controls

I added the edge case updates to OneToOneAnalysis, but it hasn't been added to any other versions of the code
